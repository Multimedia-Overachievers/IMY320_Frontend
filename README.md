# IMY 320 Website - unIQ

This repository contains a React-based website designed to assist students at the University of Pretoria in practicing for their IT module tests and exams. The website allows users to take practice tests on specific chapters within a module, and even combine multiple chapters to create timed exams. It tracks users' progress within a module, providing statistics such as average performance per chapter, completed chapters, and hours spent on each module.

## Features

- Practice tests on individual chapters within a module.
- Combine multiple chapters to create timed exams.
- Track and visualize progress within a module.
- Display statistics, including average performance per chapter, completed chapters, and hours spent on each module.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React-Router: A library for handling routing in a React application.
- Chart.js: A JavaScript charting library for creating interactive charts.
- Local JSON Storage: A pseudo backend achieved by storing information in locally stored JSON files.
